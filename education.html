            <p>The University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire is a public college in northern Wisconsin located right on the Chippewa river. When I was looking at colleges, I really didn’t know what I was looking for but both of my parents are UWEC alumni, my older sister attended for a year, and some other family members went to school here, so Eau Claire was the school I knew the most about </p>
