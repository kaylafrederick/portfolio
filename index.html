            <p>Hello! My name is Kayla Frederick, I am 20 years old, and I currently live in Eau Claire, WI. However, I am originally from Baraboo, WI, born and raised. Most of my family lives in Baraboo including my mom, dad, stepdad, grandpa, sister, brother-in-law, and dog. Baraboo is a small town right next to Wisconsin Dells which is a very popular tourist area and is referred to as “The Waterpark Capitol of the World.” I also live in Baraboo during the summer to work at the Wilderness Resort in Wisconsin Dells. Although Baraboo is not nearly as popular as the Dells, we also have many tourists come visit our state park, Devil’s Lake. Devil’s Lake is super popular in the summer but my favorite time to visit is in the fall because the weather is perfect for hiking and the colors of the trees are beautiful. I am currently in my junior year of college at the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire. I’ve changed my major twice, first being undeclared, then graphic design, and now advertising with a minor in multimedia communication. I’ve never really had a good idea of what I wanted to do when I grow up, but I’ve been enjoying advertising so far. I spend most of my free time here going to the gym, watching tv, and spending time with my roommates Haley, Emily, and Kaitlin.</p>
